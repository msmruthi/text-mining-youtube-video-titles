# text-mining-youtube-video-titles
This repo contains Python code for a Text Mining group project on the evolution of Youtube video titles. 

With 2025, marking the 20th anniversary of Youtube, the goal was to examine how Youtube video titles have changed over the decades. The data was collected through Youtube API.

The code looks at
- Hashtag usage (re)
- Evolution of usage of emojis in titles (emoji)
- Assesing clickbaitiness of video titles (using distilroberta-clickbait from Hugging Transformers)
