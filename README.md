# text-mining-youtube-video-titles
This repo contains Python code for a Text Mining group project on the evolution of Youtube video titles. 

With 2025, marking the 20th anniversary of Youtube, the goal was to examine how Youtube video titles have changed over the decades. The code looks at how hashtags, emojis and clickbaitiness of video titles have changed across the decades. The data was collected through Youtube API.
